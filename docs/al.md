I had an intuition that I needed to call earlier in order to get a response, so I did! I called back and I was transferred to Jessica D. (sounded like Jessica Dent or Dint?). Unfortunately I had to leave a voicemail again, but at least I got somewhere.

Second email follow-up (losing hope in that email address); Media Inquiries # rang a couple times and then I left another voicemail.  This is Alabama's 4:30Pm, so maybe it's worth calling them earlier in the morning and seeing if anyone picks up.

Email follow-up

### July 1, 2021
Called the Media Inquiries number, left a voicemail with my callback number. Called the Toll Free number, left a voicemail with my callback number. Sent an email to the contact address with my questions.

The following are some specific issues with this data that needs further processing and phone calls:
- Q: I noticed in the last 8 lines of the data there are alternating rows of future dates and jan 1 1970, with some strange characters in the other fields. Do these lines mean anything, or can we discard them?
